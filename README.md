<a name="intro></a>"1. For this assignment, I selected challenges 2, 3, and 4. I started on challenge
 6 and wanted to try some inheritance but didn't have time to make much progress.
Also, it wasn't until I was nearly compelte with challenges 2 and 3 that Jenna expressed an
alternative format for structuring the projects, that is why only challenge 4 is in it's own folder.
