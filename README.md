    ##**Introduction**
    For this assignment, I selected challenges 2, 3, and 4. I started on challenge
    6 and wanted to try some inheritance but didn't have time to make much progress.
    Also, it wasn't until I was nearly compelte with challenges 2 and 3 that Jenna expressed an
    alternative format for structuring the projects, that is why only challenge 4 is in it's own folder.

    I didn't make much progress on this other than the boiler plate repo pattern assemblies. I had the idea of using inheritance in the 'Car' class but quickly learned that I'd need to learn interfaces in order to do the mulitple inheritances I was thinking of. That's about when I stopped.
