    ##**Introduction**
    For this assignment, I selected challenges 2, 3, and 4. I started on challenge
    6 and wanted to try some inheritance but didn't have time to make much progress.
    Also, it wasn't until I was nearly compelte with challenges 2 and 3 that Jenna expressed an
    alternative format for structuring the projects, that is why only challenge 4 is in it's own folder.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    I didn't make much progress on this other than the boiler plate repo pattern assemblies. I had the idea of using inheritance in the 'Car' class but quickly learned that I'd need to learn interfaces in order to do the mulitple inheritances I was thinking of. That's about when I stopped.
